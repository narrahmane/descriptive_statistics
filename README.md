# Real estate purchases - descriptive statistics

The goal of this repository is to use descriptive statistics and charts to explore real estate purchases dataset.

We are exploring:
 - measurement of central tendancy
 - measurement of assymetry and variability
 - distribution of random variables

The part 1 focus on:
  - Country diversity exploration
  - Area exploration
  - Price exploration
  - Area vs. Price

The part 2 focus on:
 - Gender exploration
 - US state exploration
 - Age exploration
 - Age vs. Price


# Overall exploration results
Based on this sample dataset, we can claim the following statements:
 - Male gender is subject to sign the purchase contract.
 - The price is right skewed meaning that the majority of people are buying cheaper properties. We have some outliers around $600,000.
 - We've found that the area has a distribution curve that look likes the price distribution. Moreover, they both are right-skewed.
 - The area and price are highly correlated: 0.91 Pearson coef. It could be explained by the fact that real estate prices are sold $/sqft.
 - The age and price are lineary independant. In other words, we cannot say that young people buy cheaper house than older ones.
 - California, Nevada and Arizona are the place where the activity represent more than 80% of transaction. So, the marketing department should focus their ads to people based in those locations.

With all of those information, the marketing department is subject to target better audience.
